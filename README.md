**Role:** Financial Analyst – FinTech Industry

## 🧾 Project Overview

As a Financial Analyst, I developed a comprehensive **Three Statement Financial Model** for a hypothetical FinTech startup – **Avenir Financial Solutions Pvt. Ltd.** – aimed at serving small and minority-owned businesses with digital payment infrastructure, POS support, and merchant services.

This Excel-based model integrates the **Income Statement**, **Balance Sheet**, and **Cash Flow Statement** to forecast financial health and evaluate performance under multiple business scenarios. It empowers decision-makers to simulate outcomes, assess funding requirements, and perform sensitivity analysis.

- Taxes derived from EBIT assumptions  

### 2️⃣ Fixed Assets Schedule
- CapEx timeline and depreciation modeling  
- Straight-line depreciation applied  
- Outputs linked to P&L and Balance Sheet  

### 3️⃣ Balance Sheet
- Retained earnings linked from Net Income

### 4️⃣ Cash Flow Statement (Indirect Method)
- Net income + non-cash items + changes in working capital
